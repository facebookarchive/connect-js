Facebook JavaScript SDK
===============================

This repository contains the open source JavaScript SDK that allows you to
utilize Facebook on your website. Except as otherwise noted, the Facebook
Connect JavaScript SDK is licensed under the Apache Licence, Version 2.0
(http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

Status
------

This is an *beta* release. In order to guide the development of the library
and allow you to freely inspect and use the source, we have open sourced the
client JavaScript SDK.

Documentation
-------------

We have made API documentation available for the public APIs [here][docs]. In
addition, the code itself contains full documentation for the private APIs if
you want to study the internals.

We are maintaining a [changelog][changelog] as we update the SDK. Since this is
an Beta SDK, we might need to break compatibility between releases if the need
arises.

The repository also contains simple [examples][examples] showing the use of the
SDK with popular JavaScript libraries such as [Dojo][Dojo], [jQuery][jQuery],
[MooTools][MooTools], [Prototype][Prototype] and [YUI][YUI].

Tests
-----

We are working hard to ensure your experience using the SDK is stable. In order
to keep us nimble and allow us to bring you new functionality, without
compromising on stability, we have ensured full test coverage of the new SDK.
We are including this in the open source repository to assure you of our
commitment to quality, but also with the hopes that you will contribute back to
help keep it stable. The easiest way to do so is to file bugs and include a
test case.
